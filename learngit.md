# 23/04/2020 - Learning Git

Alright guys. So today I am going to learn git. While I have learnt it many times, I want to this time also document it properly, so that I don't end up forgetting it once more.

Now I don't use it often so it's OK if I do forget some of the syntax. But the idea here is that, to have a *self created* ready reference of the things I should know and why I should do it. Because the thing with git is that while learning the basic commands of git is easy, I end up forgetting the underlying philosphy or reason to do something. That then just doesn't work with me.

Alright, enough said. Let's get started.

OK so the way I plan to learn it is to use *gitimmersion* site. And probably this document itself can be used to just learn the basics of the git syncing.á¹­

## Setting up Name and Email and other settings.

- We should set up the global name and email the first time we start git. This enables to use this setting throughout the git usage.

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@whatever.com"
```

- Additionally to take care of the cross-platform development, we use the following :

```
git config --global core.autocrlf input  # This makes sure to convert CRLF to LF while commiting but not the other way around.
git config --global core.safecrlf true   # This is used to ensure that the binary files' eol is not touched accidentally.
```

## Create Hello World Program

- Create a folder learngit and add this file `learngit.md` in it. Additionally create a new `hello.py` program.

```
mkdir learngit
cd learngit
touch learngit.md hello.py
```

## Create Repository

- To create a repository out of a directory run the following command:

```
git init
```

## Add a file to repository

- This basically adds the file to the 'staging area' and starts 'monitoring it' but doesn't commit it. This allows to commit separate files at different times.

We can also use `git add .`  to add all the files in current directory to the staging area. But we should ensure to run `git status` first to ensure nothing gets unintentionally.

```
git add hello.py
```

## Check Repository status

```
git status
```

## Commiting the Changes

- We commit the changes using commit command . We should provide -m flag to provide meaningful message along with commit. If -m flag is forgotten then it will automatically open an editor for you to add the commit message.

```
git commit -m "my meaninful commit message"
```

## Git Tracks the changes inside the file (rather then files themselves)

- When `git add filename` is executed it basically tell git to note the current state of the file to be commited later. Any more changes done in the `git add` will not be captured in the current commit.
